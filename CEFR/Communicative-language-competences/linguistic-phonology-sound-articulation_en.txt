Sound articulation 

C2_Can articulate virtually all the sounds of the target language with clarity and precision.

C1_Can articulate virtually all the sounds of the target language with a high degree of control. They can usually self-correct if they noticeably mispronounce a sound.

B2_Can articulate a high proportion of the sounds in the target language clearly in extended stretches of production; is intelligible throughout, despite a few systematic mispronunciations.
Can generalise from their repertoire to predict the phonological features of most unfamiliar words (e.g. word stress) with reasonable accuracy (e.g. while reading).

B1_Is generally intelligible throughout, despite regular mispronunciation of individual sounds and words they are less familiar with.

A2_Pronunciation is generally intelligible when communicating in simple everyday situations, provided the interlocutor makes an effort to understand specific sounds.
Systematic mispronunciation of phonemes does not hinder intelligibility, provided the interlocutor makes an effort to recognise and adjust to the influence of the speakerâ€™s language background on pronunciation.

A1_Can reproduce sounds in the target language if carefully guided.
Can articulate a limited number of sounds, so that speech is only intelligible if the interlocutor provides support (e.g. by repeating correctly and by eliciting repetition of new sounds).
