Grammatical accuracy

C2_Maintains consistent grammatical control of complex language, even while attention is otherwise engaged (e.g. in forward planning, in monitoring others’ reactions).

C1_Consistently maintains a high degree of grammatical accuracy; errors are rare and difficult to spot.

B2+_Good grammatical control; occasional “slips” or non-systematic errors and minor flaws in sentence structure may still occur, but they are rare and can often be corrected in retrospect.

B2_Shows a relatively high degree of grammatical control. Does not make mistakes which lead to misunderstanding.
Has a good command of simple language structures and some complex grammatical forms, although they tend to use complex structures rigidly with some inaccuracy.

B1+_Communicates with reasonable accuracy in familiar contexts; generally good control, though with noticeable mother-tongue influence. Errors occur, but it is clear what they are trying to express.

B1_Uses reasonably accurately a repertoire of frequently used “routines” and patterns associated with more predictable situations.

A2_Uses some simple structures correctly, but still systematically makes basic mistakes; nevertheless, it is usually clear what they are trying to say.

A1_Shows only limited control of a few simple grammatical structures and sentence patterns in a learnt repertoire.

Pre-A1_Can employ very simple principles of word/sign order in short statements.
